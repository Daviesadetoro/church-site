The church practices the essential elements of New Testament worship, derived from the New Testament Scriptures. It is called by the same names that were used to describe the people of the Lord in apostolic days. The only unit of organization of Churches of Christ is congregational.

                    <p>Prayer is addressed to God the Father (Matt 6:9) through, or in the name of, Jesus Christ (Jno 14:13; 15:7; 16; 16:23), who plays mediatory role between God the Father and man (Rom 8:34; I Tim 2:5; Heb 7:25; I Jno 2:1).
Prayer is not addressed to “virgin Mary” or “canonized” disembodied souls or angels or spirits. Neither Jesus Christ nor His apostles nor any portion of the Scriptures authorise this practice. Rather, the Scripture forbids the worship of persons and angels (Col 2:18; Rev 22:8, 9).</p>

                    <p>The sole source of our faith is the Bible, the original text of which is uniquely inspired by God, without error; and the final authority on all matters.

                        THE CHURCH OF CHRIST was established in Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost in AD 33, some days after the resurrection of Jesus Christ and His subsequent ascension to heaven. From this date, the church passed through trials and persecutions in the hands of the Jews as well as the Roman authorities who were the ruling power of the time. Before his death, Jesus promised to build His church (Matt. 16:18-19), the fulfillment of which came to pass on the Day of Pentecost in AD 33
                    </p>
                        <p class="history-para" hidden>
                        Jesus told the apostles that they will be persecuted (Lk 11:49; Matt. 5:11-12). He talked about the level of sufferings that will come after His death. He predicted the destruction of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem (Luke 19:41-44, Luke 21:5-6, Matt 24:1-2). The Scriptures are full of predictions about the establishment of the church in Jerusalem and her ultimate spread to all corners of the world. The church was thus established after Jesus shed His blood to purchase her (Acts 20:28). The early members of the church were called Christians (Acts 11:26).
                    </p>
                    <p class="history-para" hidden>
                    For professing Jesus Christ, the early Christians were killed, fed to lions, burnt at the stake, banished to dark places and thrown into jail. Many were beheaded, some were crucified, yet they refused to deny Jesus Christ. As instruments of persecution forced them to run from one place to another they carried the message of the cross as pre-occupation. They never reneged in their services to God, despite the torrent of lies put on their heads by the Roman Emperors.
                    </p>
                    <p class="history-para" hidden>
                        Apostasy, however, set in within the church as the Scriptures had predicted. In the second century the original practices of the church were diluted and polluted. This led to the introduction of human doctrines in worship, and the departure from apostolic doctrines. Subsequently, it became difficult to demarcate between state policies and church doctrines.
